# Neighborhood-Safety-App
The neighborhood safety app is a community-driven software solution designed to enhance public safety and infrastructure management by providing residents with a platform to report and track local safety issues.


For this project, we are using [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

Dependences
-----------
We'll need the following to get started:

* [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) installed on a physical device
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (LTS version) installed

Set up/Build
-------
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the Neighborhood-Safety-App folder in your terminal.
3. In your terminal, run the following:
    ```
    npx expo start
    ```
4. Depending on your machine, this may take a few minutes but you should see something like this:
    ![run expo start](./run%20expo%20start.png)
5. Once this is loaded, load the app using your preferred method. To stop the build, hit ````Ctrl + C```` in the terminal.

Happy coding!
